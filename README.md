## A JavaScript Blockchain Network

This project is for my 4th year SCIT project that will be accessible via this [link](https://#.com/) someday. 
I hope to build a web app overlay the network that will use the concept of blockchain for performance and integrity.

### Note 

The application is build with javascript with some [es6 syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_es6.asp?msclkid=35aa6afcc65f11eca77e935626fec707) modifications and typescript in mind. Tests are run with [jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) and [babel-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-jest).
